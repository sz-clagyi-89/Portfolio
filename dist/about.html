                <p>I have been learning Front-end wed development for a bit more then a half year. Besides gaining solid JavaScript fundamentals both in vanilla JS and ES6 by developping several projects (,budget Calculator project or a recipe seeker app,) I can state that I could implement my own idea into one of them utilizing the materials learnt (currency exchange feature). I got familiarized with modular development (MVC) as well as the basics of NPM - Webpack, Babel tools and Node.js basics. After and during the courses I took some turnoff to acquire CSS grids to build fancy responsive layouts and using CLI confidently as well as bootstrap. With the practical usage of MDN or other recources when something is needed, I reckon that I have the essential tools and thinking process as well as enthusiasm to be a great fit for a company as a junior developer.</p>
